  accessibility_description: >
    Screen readers treat items as an unsorted list. Once selected, items can be categorized
    using the arrow keys. Keyboard controls are communicated visually and to screen readers.
  generation_prompt: >
    Each individual question represents an item that must be placed in its property category. The category for an item is
    identified by the text property of each question's answer property. Category text must be consistent across all items that
    share the same category. Ideally, multiple items share the same category, and are all each contextually related to a single
    category. There should not be more than 6 total categories.
